00:00:00.219 --> 00:00:01.996
- you ever wondered how we made this song?

2
00:00:06.882 --> 00:00:15.729
- Okay. I'm gonna show you how Okay. There's this amazing simon and ga song called my little town. And during the fade out, there's this really incredible horn line. Listen.

3
00:00:19.854 --> 00:00:28.515
- And we thought that was the catch melody ever, but it only happens during the fade out of the song. We wanted to make that a song unto itself. We added a nice big eight zero eight

4
00:00:29.935 --> 00:00:30.775
- clap and snaps.

5
00:00:32.148 --> 00:00:33.686
- And some organic high hats.

6
00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:43.059
- If your hi hats are sounding a little boring, I find a nice trick is to add like a real thumb sound into them. Like this ticking clock and added some vocals?

7
00:00:44.655 --> 00:00:46.131
- And we put it together like this.
